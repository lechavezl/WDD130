      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Video games have been popular for a long time. Every year, we can observe new releases that are better than the previous ones. Since the pandemic started, this kind of entertainment has become more popular and interesting, so the number of video game fans increases considerably every day. For this reason, I want to create a video game website, where people can find information about their favorite video games, recent eSports, new releases, and also guides and tips to become great gamers. In this way, all those gamers who like to show their skills will be aware of everything that happens in this great world.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People of all ages who like video games, from kids to adults. So a large percentage of people will be my audience. But to be more specific, even though a lot of people like video games, this kind of entertainment is more popular among those who are 12 to 25 years old. This is because they have less responsibilities than other adults, so they can spend more time playing video games, visiting blogs and watching eSports. So they will be the primary audience for my website, where I can provide them with the information they need.</p>  <!-- change this -->
