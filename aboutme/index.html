    <h2>Luis Chavez</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone My name is Luis Chavez. I am 23 years old and I got married 4 months ago. I chose programming and web development because I really like this career. I think it will be a challenge, but I know that with effort and dedication I can do it, and I wish you the best in this course.</p>

    <p>About my hobbies, I like to play video games or watch TV series in my free time. I also like to listen to music (I enjoy listening carefully to realize all the sounds that make up the song).</p>

    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since I was a child. When my parents where baptized, I was 4 years old. I served a mission in Venezuela Caracas Mission. I finished my mission in 2019 and got married in December 2021.</p>
    
    <p>I work as a copywriter, my job is to create content for websites and their blogs. I like it very much, I got this job after learning in Pathway how to write essays. I will do my best in this semester, I wish you all the best and if there is anything I can help with just let me know!</p>
