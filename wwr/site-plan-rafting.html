    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Many people are looking for a beautiful place where they can share a beautiful and comfortable moment in family. One time where they can forget all their daily worries and just concentrate on the fun and specialness of sharing favorable moments together. Also, many want to spend a very energetic day with their circle of friends. That’s what we want to give them, a place where they can enjoy an incredible day and fulfill all their expectations. Here in Super Rafting you will not only spend a fun time, but you will have the opportunity to create moments that time will not erase and that adrenaline will make you feel it.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience is divided into two main targets. One of them are large families that are looking to spend time together and forget all the daily occupations by doing rafting, eating delicious food and spend a few days sleeping in comfortable and cozy cabins. They have a good income to prepare a small vacation and enjoy themselves. The other main target are young people full of energy who crave adventure and feel the adrenaline rush through their bodies. They live in different parts of the city and usually come in groups of friends. They don’t commonly have enough income to spend several days, but they like to spend a whole day and go home after having fun. Both of my main targets will visit my website by using desktop computers and mobile devices.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
